# App 6/365: "Scroll Hollow"

🧠 Concept
A minimalist, eerie app that visualizes the mental emptiness left by endless scrolling. Instead of content, the user sees empty “slots” resembling posts — but all of them are blank, flickering, or filled with random symbols, glitches, or half-finished phrases.

There are no likes. No comments. No memes.
No goal — just the loop.
No sound — just the hiss of digital silence.

🎨 Aesthetic
Glitch art + suffocating UI, reminiscent of old Android systems
A scrollable feed where… nothing really happens
Backgrounds: twitching pixels, frozen gradients
Subtle, repeated animations like someone mindlessly swiping
Occasionally, a phrase appears:
“Still here?”
“Do you feel anything yet?”
“Try again.”

💬 Purpose
To reflect how some modern apps are reward shells — feeding habits but giving no substance.
Not a critique — but an aesthetic mirror of behavior.
